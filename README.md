# Content Driven LLM APIs

## Description
This project offers a set of developer-friendly APIs that enable users to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM) using their own content. Users can submit documents or text, which the system stores and organizes. When a question is posed, the system retrieves the most relevant content and leverages the LLM to generate a response based on that information.

(Future Plans)
This project abstracts away the complexities of working with LangChain and language models. Developers can integrate advanced LLM functionality into their applications without needing deep knowledge of LangChain or how to connect with language models.
